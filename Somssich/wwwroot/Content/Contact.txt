I welcome your comments and feedback, as well as suggestions for new legislation.

You can reach me either by Phone at (603) 436-5382
by Email: <a href="mailto:staterep27nh@gmail.com">staterep27nh@gmail.com</a>, and of course by regular mail at 34 Swett Ave.  Portsmouth, NH 03801

To all residents in Ward 3, I pledge to make every effort to listen to your comments, but in the end I'll have to make a decision to vote one way or another based on what is best for our city and our state. Even if you do not agree with my vote, please don't hesitate to call and I will be glad to tell you why I voted the way I did.
